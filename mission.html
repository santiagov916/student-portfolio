                Truly, to understand someone is to know their motives, ambitions, intentions, and inspirations. I'd like all to know I do programming to leave my thumbprint on our planet for God and for the sake of good works. I chose a trade that can improve the lives of many people who own businesses, have a vision, and a spirit to help others. I am not just doing this for a paycheck but even beyond that this career is to start a revolution in my family, my city, and in myself. With the experience gained from my very first code, to my first running programming: I see a very different world impacted by my vision. I am not just a regular person looking for a job, I'm here to do great things and master the mundane! With practical steps and effort everyday, I CAN DO ALL THINGS THROUGH CHRIST WHO STRENGTHENS ME!
