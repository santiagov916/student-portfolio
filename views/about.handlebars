                Born and raised in Sacramento, Ca, I have always loved to solve problems and figure out the puzzle of things! Coding allows me 
                to help people's needs on a grand scale and also is one of my favorite things to do: puzzles! I've learned most of my coding from 
                UC Davis coding camp, countless hours studying, training, and coding, and also going on to create some of my own work here on display!
